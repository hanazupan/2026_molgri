    Given a 1D grid (eg. [0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5]) that might or might not be periodic and 1D points (eg. [0.6, -5.2, 1.7]),
    return an array of indices that tell you which gridpoint is closest to this point.

    When there is no periodicity, this is easy - the gridpoint with the smallest absolute value of difference is the
    closest one.

    If we have a periodic system, the limits play a role, because each gridpoint is infinitely repeated. We use a mod
    operator to get the closest gridpoint.

        points_to_assign (NDArray): an array of shape (N_trajlen,) of points to be assigned
        grid_points (NDArray): an array of shape (N_gridpoints,) of 1D gridpoints
        limits (NDArray): a list of two numbers, the lower and upper limit, eg. [0.0, 2.0]
        is_periodic (bool): True if the grid is supposed to be periodic, if False points outside the grid will be
        assigned to the smallest or largest values
